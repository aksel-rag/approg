            <h1>Welcome to Duck World!</h1>
            <p> Begin by creating a duck, naming it, and starting to play. Your duck will have four attributes:</p>
            <p><b>Happiness<br>Cleanliness<br>Hunger<br>Sleepyness</b></p>
                <p>The duck's happiness will decrease and increase based on its other main attributes. <br><br>
                    If the duck's hunger falls below 35, it will lose 33% of its happiness. <br><br>If the duck becomes tired and reaches the "sleepy" stage, it will again lose 33% of its happiness.<br><br>If the duck becomes dirty, you will see its appearance and mood change, and this will also cause its happiness to be reduced.<br><br> If these three stats fall below the thresholds, the duck will die of boredom.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Your duck's attributes such as sleep and cleanliness decrease every 10 seconds, and hunger is reduced every 3 seconds.</p>
                <br><br>
                <strong>Dev Options</strong>
                <br>
                <p>Enabling dev options allows you to reduce the hunger, cleanliness, and sleep status manually.</p>
